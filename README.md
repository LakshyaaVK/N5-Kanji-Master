#KanjiMaster
I couldnâ€™t find a proper tool to help study all the JLPT N5-level Kanji, so I decided to build one myself.

This app is designed for learners who want a visual, intuitive, and progressive way to explore all 120+ N5 kanji, along with:
	â€¢	âœ… Stroke count, readings (Onyomi/Kunyomi), meanings
	â€¢	ðŸ§  Vocabulary examples with pronunciation
	â€¢	ðŸ“Š Learning progress tracking
	â€¢	ðŸ”Š Pronunciation audio support
	â€¢	ðŸŒ™ Light/Dark Mode support
	â€¢	âš¡ Fast performance using React + Vite

Whether youâ€™re a beginner in Japanese or preparing for the JLPT N5 exam, this tool helps you master the kanji at your own pace â€” without distractions.
